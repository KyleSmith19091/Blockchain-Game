# Blockchain-Game

## What is this?
I have always been fascinated with the workings of blockchain technologies, partly from hearing about bitcoin. I decided to a
little research to see how one would implement a simple blockchain 'system'. I also wanted to learn more about hashing algorithms.
The program that I have written allows you to create a Blockchain and when a block is added, a mining operation is performed, the
difficulty of the hash is a hard coded value. The block hashes are calculated using a SHA256 algorithm which is not my own, as I
would like to create a seperate project for hashing algorithms, as with this project I wanted a basic understanding of blockchain 
systems.

## What did I do to make this project special?
I found it a bit boring waiting for my computer to mine the new hash that was created for a block. I created a game around
the 'mining' of a block. The user has a chance of being a hacker or a 'cyber force' operative, the game is to look at how
many iterations it takes the user and the 'computer' to compute the hash. In actuality it is still the computer that is computing
both of the hashes, but due to the hashes being different, the iterations also differ. If the hacker does it in less iterations, then 
the hacker is able to take the 'varCoins', but if the cyber force operative can due it in less iterations than the hacker then he
has protected the network and the varCoins transaction can go to its original user.
